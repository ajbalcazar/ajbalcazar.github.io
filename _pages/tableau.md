The participation of women in elected office varies in terms of political party and role. There are twice as many women serving in elected roles at the state and federal levels in the Democratic Party as compared to the Republican Party. Across state legislatures, 32% of State Representatives (1736 out of 5411), and 29% of State Senators are women (564 out of 1972). At the federal level, 28% of U.S. Representatives are women (121 out of 435), and 24% of U.S. Senators are women (24 out of 100).
