### Non-Taxable Properties - City of Garland, TX

The following map displays the spatial distribution of non-taxable properties in the City of Garland, TX. The director of the Economic Development Department wanted to know the number of properties and total acres of non-taxable land. The director also wanted the total number of developable acres (non-flood plane) of non-taxable properties. This analysis required an overlay of a flood plane layer and creating new fields to calculate developable acres.
