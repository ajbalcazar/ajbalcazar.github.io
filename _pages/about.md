### Non-Taxable Properties - City of Garland, TX

The following map displays spatial distribution of non-taxable properties in the City of Garland, TX. The director of the Economic Development Department wanted to know how many non-taxable properties there were across the city and how many total acres they amount to. The director also wanted to know how many developable acres there were of non-taxable properties. This analysis required an overlay of a flood plane layer and creating new fields to calculate developable acres (non-flood plane total area).
